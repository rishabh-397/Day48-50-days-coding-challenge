## ðŸ§® Problem 1: Is the Array Good?

### Description:
Given an array nums of positive integers, determine if it's "good", i.e., you can pick a subset and integer multipliers such that the sum becomes exactly 1.

### Approach:
This is a classic *number theory* problem. An array is good if the *GCD of all elements is 1* (BÃ©zout's Identity). If GCD > 1, you can't represent 1.

### Example:
Input: nums = [12, 5, 7, 23]  
Output: true

## ðŸ§  Problem 2: Hamming Distance

### Description:
Calculate the number of differing bits (set bits in XOR) between two integers.

### Approach:
- Perform XOR between x and y
- Count set bits using bit manipulation

### Example:
Input: x = 1, y = 4  
Output: 2
